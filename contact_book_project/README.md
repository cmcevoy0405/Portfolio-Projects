Title: Contact Book

Description:
This project runs a basic configuration of a contact book. The application starts by prompting the user whether they would like to add a contact, find a contact, view all contacts, update a contact, delete a contact or exit the program.  The user can add a contact by supplying the name, email and phone number of the contact, the user can then find a contact by inputting the contacts name, the program will then return all information on the contact with that name. The user can view all contacts, returning every instance of a dictionary within the list of contacts. The user can delete a contact by inputting the contacts name, this will delete all information related to that contact.
If no contacts exists in the contact book, a message will be displayed prompting the user to input contacts into the book. Additionally if the user either wants to find, update or delete a contact and they type in an unrecognized name, they will be displayed a message saying that the contact is not found.
Future improvements to this code would involve implementing regular expressions to verify all user inputs and avoid incorrect information being stored in the contact book.

Title: Inventory project

Description: In this project I created an inventory application that displays several functions.

To add an item into the inventory the user is prompted with the item to enter, the quantity of the item and the price of the item. They are then prompted with a message to either enter another item or go back to the 'main menu'. The code ensures data types are handled correctly.

The user can then view the stock menu, this displays all items in the menu, the quantity and the price of each. The total price per item is displayed also. A grand total is then displayed, that contains all the totals of each item summed.

To delete an item, the user enters the item they wish to delete from the final stock list, if the item exists it is removed from the list.

The user can update and item by inputting which item they wish to update and changing the item name, price or quantity.

If a sale is made, depending on the amount of units sold, it will remove that quantity from the final stock list. If the stock drops to zero, it is removed from the final stock list altogether. The total and grand total automatically updates.

If a return is made, the quantity returned is added to the final stock list. The total and grand total automatically updates.

The user can additionally quit the program whenever they wish
